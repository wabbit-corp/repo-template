# Contributor License Agreement (CLA) v1.0

## {{COMPANY_FULL_NAME}} Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the {{COMPANY_FULL_NAME}} ("{{COMPANY_NAME}}") project. This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") sets out the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the project. {{COMPANY_NAME}} values its contributors and, where appropriate, will provide attribution for significant contributions in project documentation or other materials.

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** means the individual or legal entity making the contribution.
- **"Contribution"** means any work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to {{COMPANY_NAME}} for inclusion in the project.
- **"Project"** means the software project primarily licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) and managed by {{COMPANY_NAME}}, with the understanding that {{COMPANY_NAME}} may also offer commercial licensing options.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to {{COMPANY_NAME}} and to recipients of software distributed by {{COMPANY_NAME}} a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

To the extent permissible by applicable law, you agree not to assert any moral rights in your Contributions against {{COMPANY_NAME}} or its licensees.

### 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to {{COMPANY_NAME}}.

You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation. You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

### 4. Third-Party Submissions

Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to {{COMPANY_NAME}} separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]," ensuring you have proper authorization from the original authors or rights holders.

### 5. Retention of Rights

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to {{COMPANY_NAME}}. Except for the rights and licenses granted herein to {{COMPANY_NAME}} and recipients of software distributed by {{COMPANY_NAME}}, You reserve any remaining right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions. This retention does not affect the comprehensive rights granted to {{COMPANY_NAME}} as outlined in Sections 2 and 3.

### 6. Licensing Terms

By submitting Contributions, you understand and agree that {{COMPANY_NAME}} may license your Contributions under any terms, including open-source licenses such as AGPL-3.0, proprietary licenses, and commercial licenses, at {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s discretion. {{COMPANY_NAME}} commits to always making the Project available under an open-source license, though the specific license may change.

### 7. Consideration

You agree that the opportunity to participate in the development of the Project and the potential for your Contributions to be included in the Project constitute good and valuable consideration for the rights granted herein. You understand and agree that you will not receive any monetary compensation or payment for your Contributions. Your Contributions are made voluntarily and without any expectation of financial reward. {{COMPANY_NAME}} may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer rewards, acknowledgments, or other forms of non-monetary recognition for significant contributions, but such recognition is not guaranteed and does not constitute compensation for your Contributions.

### 18. No Third-Party Beneficiaries

This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this Agreement.

The party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall:

If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding ninety (90) consecutive days, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other party, without incurring any liability as a result of such termination. Such termination shall not affect the rights and obligations accrued prior to the Force Majeure Event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s obligation to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures, nor shall it excuse any payment obligations under this Agreement.
