- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to {{COMPANY_NAME}} for inclusion in the Project, such as source code, documentation, or other materials. For example, submitting a pull request or patch via email constitutes a Contribution.

You hereby grant to {{COMPANY_NAME}} and to recipients of software distributed by {{COMPANY_NAME}} a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

#### 2.2 Grant of Moral Rights
To the extent permissible by applicable law, you agree not to assert any moral rights in your Contributions against {{COMPANY_NAME}} or its licensees.

### 3. Representations and Warranties

#### 3.1 Legal Capacity
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to {{COMPANY_NAME}}.

#### 3.2 Original Work
You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation. 

#### 3.3 Third-Party Rights
You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

#### 3.4. Age and Consent
You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction (which may be 18, 16, or another age as defined by local laws). If you are under the age of majority, you must have your parent or guardian's verifiable permission to contribute and enter into this Agreement.

#### 3.5 Consent for Attribution
You consent to the use of your name, username, and any other identifying information you provide for the purpose of giving attribution for your Contributions.

#### 3.6 Compliance with Laws
You represent that your Contributions and your entering into this Agreement comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.

### 4. Third-Party Submissions
Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to {{COMPANY_NAME}} separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]," ensuring you have proper authorization from the original authors or rights holders.

You agree not to submit any materials that you know or reasonably should know include any unauthorized third-party intellectual property. {{COMPANY_NAME}} reserves the right to reject or remove any Contributions that it believes may infringe on third-party rights.

### 5. Retention of Rights
You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to {{COMPANY_NAME}}. Except for the rights and licenses granted herein to {{COMPANY_NAME}} and recipients of software distributed by {{COMPANY_NAME}}, You reserve any remaining right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions. This retention does not affect the comprehensive rights granted to {{COMPANY_NAME}} as outlined in Sections 2 and 3.

### 6. Licensing Terms
By submitting Contributions, you understand and agree that {{COMPANY_NAME}} may license your Contributions under any terms, including open-source licenses such as AGPL-3.0, proprietary licenses, and commercial licenses, at {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s discretion. This means your Contributions may be included in versions of the Project that are distributed under licenses different from the one under which you originally contributed, including proprietary versions. {{COMPANY_NAME}} currently commits to making the Project available under an open-source license, though the specific license may change. However, {{COMPANY_NAME}} reserves the right to alter this commitment in the future, while honoring the terms under which previous Contributions were made.

### 7. Consideration
You agree that the opportunity to participate in the development of the Project and the potential for your Contributions to be included in the Project constitute good and valuable consideration for the rights granted herein. You understand and agree that you will not receive any monetary compensation or payment for your Contributions. Your Contributions are made voluntarily and without any expectation of financial reward. {{COMPANY_NAME}} may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer rewards, acknowledgments, or other forms of non-monetary recognition for significant contributions, but such recognition is not guaranteed and does not constitute compensation for your Contributions.

### 8. Independent Contributor Status
You agree that you are participating as an independent contributor and not as an employee, agent, or representative of {{COMPANY_NAME}}. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between you and {{COMPANY_NAME}}.

### 9. Data Protection and Privacy
{{COMPANY_NAME}} will collect and process personal data necessary for the administration of contributions in accordance with its Privacy Policy contained in [CONTRIBUTOR_PRIVACY.md](CONTRIBUTOR_PRIVACY.md). By entering into this Agreement, you consent to such processing of your personal data.

### 10. Indemnification and Liability Limitations
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless {{COMPANY_NAME}}, its officers, directors, and agents, against any claim arising from your breach of the representations and warranties in this Agreement. This indemnification obligation shall be limited to actual damages incurred by {{COMPANY_NAME}}, and in no event shall your total liability exceed the actual damages incurred by {{COMPANY_NAME}} as a direct result of your breach.

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS.

### 11. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE PROJECT AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL {{COMPANY_NAME}} BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROJECT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this Agreement.

Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing their obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions, power failures, or internet disturbances ("Force Majeure Event"). 

The party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall:
(a) Promptly notify the other party in writing of the nature and extent of the Force Majeure Event;

If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding ninety (90) consecutive days, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other party, without incurring any liability as a result of such termination. Such termination shall not affect the rights and obligations accrued prior to the Force Majeure Event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s obligation to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures, nor shall it excuse any payment obligations under this Agreement.
