# Simplified CLA Clauses

Throughout this agreement, you might come across some terms that aren't common in everyday language. Here's what they mean:

1. **Patent**: A patent is a type of intellectual property right that gives an inventor the legal right to prevent others from making, using, or selling their invention for a certain period of time.

2. **Arbitration**: This is a way of resolving disputes outside of courts. An independent person (the arbitrator) hears both sides of the argument and makes a decision.

3. **Jurisdiction**: This refers to the official power to make legal decisions and judgments. In this agreement, it means which country's laws apply and which courts would handle any legal issues.

4. **Liability**: This refers to legal responsibility for something. When we talk about limiting liability, we're talking about putting a cap on how much someone could be legally responsible for.

5. **Force Majeure**: This is a fancy term for events that are out of everyone's control, like natural disasters or wars, that prevent someone from fulfilling their obligations under an agreement.
